  _description: It seems like someone is behind all this. Please investigate the
    5th floor and kill the wolves who try to stop you.
  _introQuestDialogue: It seems like someone has been planning something... can you
    go find out and kill wolves as you investigate?
  _activeQuestDialogue: You still don't know who's behind this...
  _completedQuestDialogue: Hmm. Killing the wolves gave us no information. I guess
    we'll have to investigate more.
